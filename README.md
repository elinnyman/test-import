# uncoupling-beyond-UCP1

The files here can be used to simulate the final model in the paper "Systems biology reveals uncoupling beyond UCP1 in human white fat-derived beige adipocytes"

To simulate the figures in the paper, run the file plotAll.m in Matlab

Note: The MatLab toolbox IQM Tools Pro SB (IntiQuan; http://www.intiquan.com) is needed to run the scripts.
