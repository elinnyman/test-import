# uncoupling-beyond-UCP1

The files here can be used to simulate the models for the tested hypotheses (H1-H3) in the paper "Systems biology reveals uncoupling beyond UCP1 in human white fat-derived beige adipocytes"

To simulate the models, download all files and run the file plotAll.m in Matlab

Note: The MatLab toolbox IQM Tools Pro SB (IntiQuan; http://www.intiquan.com) is needed to run the scripts.
